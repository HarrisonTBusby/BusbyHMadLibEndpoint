This program takes a bunch of user inputted nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc... into the URL and the the terminal spits out a story using those variables.

Peer reviewed by:Peer Review By: Kenneth Fujimura â€” Everything works. All of the variables were called in the correct ways, at the right time. The API and the pulling inputs from the URL also worked. The story was cute. No real errors. Great job, Harrison!
